# About Me

I joined DRW Holdings as a quantitative researcher in October 2020.
I use statistics and machine learning to research financial markets and, some day, develop principled trading strategies.

I hold a Ph.D. in political science from the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, where I used Bayesian statistical methods to study U.S. elections and public opinion with the [Elections Research Center](https://elections.wisc.edu/).
My dissertation developed new Bayesian methods to measure political ideology in the electorate and its effects in congressional primary elections.
My other political science research uses Bayesian and/or causal inference methods to study voter identification requirements, electoral coalitions, and election forecasts. 
My research is published in the _Election Law Journal_ and _The Forum_, and it has been covered by the New York Times, the Washington Post, FiveThirtyEight, and more.

I am originally from St. Louis MO and went to college at the University of Missouri.
I've also lived in Berkeley CA for a few summers.

For recreation, I like to play guitar (badly) and ride a road bike (slightly less badly).
I am trying to learn more about mixing cocktails.
