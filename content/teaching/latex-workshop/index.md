# Political Science Graduate LaTeX/RMarkdown Workshop

Annual graduate workshop for typesetting professional research documents with LaTeX and R Markdown.
I was involved in preparing this workshop from 2015–2018 and led the workshop beginning in 2017. 

All materials for the workshop are publicly available in their 2018 vintage on my [Github](https://github.com/mikedecr/latex-workshop-2018).
