# Political Science 270: Understanding Political Numbers

Data are increasingly prevalent in politics (and in journalism, industry, academia...), but data are complex and challenging. 
What can we learn about politics, and the social world more broadly, when we take an empirical view of it? When should we trust data, and when will data lead us astray? 

Political science 270 is an undergraduate course on consuming, criticizing, and producing data-driven analysis of political and social phenomena. 
Students learn to think about political data as evidence for or against social theories. 
The course emphasis practical data analysis skills that apply beyond the political science curriculum, including elementary statistical analysis, R programming (`Rstudio`, `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`), and technical writing.
